GitGinie is the GitHub Automation Application developed by our team **StageOverStash** during **All In Open Source Hackathon 2023**. It isn't a simple application, it comes up with the UI where you can customise the messages you want on triggering the workflows.

**CONTRIBUTORS**
- While contributing to various Open Source projects, we have observed that getting responses over issues, or pull requests used to take a lot of time. Also it's really natural that project maintainers are really busy with their works as well, so getting responses may take time. 

**PROJECT MAINTAINERS**
- The only major challenge while working with large scale open source projects is maintaining workflows.
- Responding to each and every issue is very tedious. When there is a large scale project and more than one project maintainers are working together, it's chaotic to go through issues, and PRs and respond each one. 
- Adding labels to issues is also time consuming task, so GitGinie comes here.

#### **GitGinie is a GitHub Automation Application for Contributers, for maintainers and for our Open Source Community.**<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Smilies/Growing%20Heart.png" alt="Growing Heart" width="25" height="25" />
